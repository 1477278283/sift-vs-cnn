# Comparisong of SIFT and CNN

This project compares using SIFT with color features and both trained and pretrained CNNs in a butterfly classification task.

## TODO / thoughts

- [ ] Improve data preprocessing when training the neural network by doing random cropping
- [ ] Make sure the tensor color dimensions are appropriate for OpenCV
